This is the game "Connect Four", designed for CS5001: Intensive Foundations of CS

This is the final project for an Object-Oriented design related class which imphasized good coding practices with Python. There were numerous design specifications which had to be followed. This program features the classic 2 player game, completed using 'turtle' graphics. The board had to be scalable to different sizes, and the 'AI' implementation of computer moves was optional (an option which I wasn't ready for at the time!). You can choose between a 2-player (one-on-one human players) game, or a computer player that simply picks moves at random (very easy to beat, of course). We also had to thoroughly test our application. This is the first 'large', object-oriented program that I had to design from scratch. This program inspired me to make many other games to practice new elements of software design.
